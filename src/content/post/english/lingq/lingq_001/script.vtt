00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.050
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.780
Are you ready to understand fast English conversations?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.820
Let's talk about it.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.570
Speaking naturally and fluently in English
is a great skill, but when you're having a

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.810
conversation, if you can't understand what
the other person is saying, you're going to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.370
have a big problem.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.720
So today, I want to share with you my top
tip that will help you to understand fast

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.400
English conversations.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.620
Today you're going to learn how to understand
fast English conversations, we're going to

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.110
practice this method together right now today,
and then I'm going to help you know how to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.450
continue practicing this method so that it
doesn't just stop today so that you can continue

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.430
and build your listening skills.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.559
So how can you understand fast conversations?

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.610
Can you learn like a child, just taking in
a lot of information for two, three, four,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.540
five years, 24/7?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.560
Or maybe you just think, "Oh, I can watch
English TV shows 500 times and eventually

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.560
I'll just understand what they're saying"?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.039
Well, if you listen to these conversations
and you only understand 10%, 20%, we need

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.789
to take it back a little bit.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:28.939
The best way to understand fast English speakers
is to study and analyze native real conversations.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.099
Make sure that you understand each word and
then you can also imitate that same sentence

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.179
structure yourself when you speak.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.119
Today, we're going to be doing this together.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.829
We're going to be analyzing a short English
conversation, including some idioms, expressions,

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.689
phrasal verbs that are included in that conversation.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.619
So what I want you to do is I want you to
get a pen and pencil ready because I want

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.950
you to be active during today's lesson.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.060
We're going to be following four steps.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.439
The first step is to listen to a fast, original
conversation clip.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.770
We're going to be listening to a clip from
a guy named Nathan, who is a native English

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.950
speaker, and he's going to be talking a little
bit about his experience with an international

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.810
public speaking organization called Toastmasters.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.409
Then number two, we're going to listen to
a slow version of this clip.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.230
This means that hopefully in the slow version,
you're going to catch each word, you're going

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.140
to hear words that you didn't hear the first
time because with Nathan it was pretty fast,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.569
but in the slowed down version it's going
to be a little bit clearer for you to hear

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.920
each word.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.830
Step number three is to write everything that
you hear.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.329
Whatever you hear Nathan say, whatever you
hear me say, try to write exactly what you

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.329
hear.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.290
And in the fourth step, we're going to check
your writing with the original transcript.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.209
You'll probably see, "Oh, I got that word
correct.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.989
I didn't know that that's what they said,
but I wrote it correctly."

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.730
And you'll probably also see, "Oh wow, I didn't
hear that at all," maybe there are some linkings

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.480
and reductions that you didn't know before.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.000
So this is a good way to test what you know
and also test what's difficult for you so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.799
that you can improve that.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.579
Maybe you don't write the correct word because
you simply don't know it, maybe it's a new

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.360
vocabulary word for you.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.010
This is a good way to expand your vocabulary.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.010
Today, we're going to be talking about three
words that you're going to hear in the conversation

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.060
with Nathan, so hopefully those will just
add to your vocabulary.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.420
Today's YouTube lesson is a free sample of
my course, the 30 Day Listening Challenge,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.510
which opens today, December 20th.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.140
In the course, you'll study one lesson exactly
like what we're going to do today.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.379
You're going to build your listening skills
day by day.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.160
Students who have joined past Listening Challenges
have said that the first few days in the course

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.359
are generally pretty tough.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.810
This is a difficult technique because you're
trying to listen for every single word, but

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.569
after a few days it gets easier and easier,
and you really are building your listening

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.569
skills.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.480
So if it's challenging for you, push on.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.540
You can do it.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.250
Remember that I said you'll need a pen and
a piece of paper?

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.459
Well, today is an active lesson, you need
to participate.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.539
Let's take a look at the worksheet so that
you can see exactly what I want you to be

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.299
writing down on your paper.

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.850
Here's the conversation outline, first you'll
hear Nathan's voice, then you'll hear my voice,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.569
then his, then mine.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:35.420
And if you have a piece of paper, I recommend
writing at least N, V, N, V, N, V so that

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.810
you can prepare yourself for what you're going
to hear.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.740
This is actually day 25 of the 30-day Listening
Challenge, but it's a free sample today.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.470
The course is open now December 20th to December
31st for only $30.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.509
This means that on January 25th, you will
study this lesson, but today it's a free sample.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.160
Now let's listen to the fast original version
of this conversation.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.530
The clip is only 30 seconds, so it's going
to go pretty fast, but try to write what you

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.730
hear.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.010
Test your listening skills.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.540
Let's listen.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.580
Nathan: You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.949
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one to two minute speech

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:18.949
off the cuff.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:19.949
Vanessa: Wow.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.490
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.030
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.440
Nathan: Right.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.160
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.220
most.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.560
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.940
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one to two minute speech

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.940
off the cuff.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
Vanessa: Wow.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.470
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.020
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.420
Nathan: Right.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.120
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.210
most.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.540
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.159
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one two minute speech off

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.159
the cuff.

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.159
Vanessa: Wow.

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.460
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.000
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.409
Nathan: Right.

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.129
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:10.129
most.

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.860
Vanessa: Did you feel like that was definitely
too fast?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.970
Well, Nathan was speaking pretty naturally,
and I was too.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.669
Native English speakers can definitely understand
this conversation, so I want you to be able

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.050
to do that too.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.349
You'll hear this style of speaking when you
travel to the US, when you have a business

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.750
meeting, when you meet some international
friends so this is a good way to test your

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.169
listening skills.

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.360
Now let's go to the slow version.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.629
Remember, this is step two.

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:44.229
You're going to hear my husband, Dan, and
I say the exact same words that you just heard

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.921
from the conversation with Nathan, but when
my husband Dan and I say these words, it's

00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.039
going to be reduced significantly.

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.849
It's going to be slower.

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.470
It's going to be clearer.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.629
Hopefully, you'll pick up on other words that
you didn't hear in the conversation with Nathan.

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.400
All right, let's listen.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.979
Dan: You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:12.919
Dan: And you have to get up in front of the
group and do a one to two minute speech off

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:13.919
the cuff.

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:14.919
Vanessa: Wow.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.480
Dan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.600
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.379
Dan: Right.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:30.039
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.900
most.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.680
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:43.620
Dan: And you have to get up in front of the
group and do a one to two minute speech off

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.620
the cuff.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.620
Vanessa: Wow.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.180
Dan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.290
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.080
Dan: Right.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.740
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.599
most.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:07.379
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:14.310
Dan: And you have to get up in front of the
group and do a one to two minute speech off

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.310
the cuff.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.310
Vanessa: Wow.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.669
Dan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:08:20.669 --> 00:08:23.990
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.780
Dan: Right.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.419
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.419
most.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.690
Vanessa: Did you write down everything that
you heard?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.540
In the 30 Day Listening Challenge, you're
going to be able to download or stream those

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.480
audio files so you can listen to them as many
times as you want.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.430
This is just a sample, this is just a practice,
but you're welcome to pause the video and

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.400
go back and listen to them again.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.500
How was it?

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.200
Was it too slow?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.420
Was it too fast?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.690
Did you pick on some words that you didn't
hear the first time?

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.390
I hope so.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.240
Now we're going to take a look at the transcript.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.820
This is step number four.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:08.120
And you're going to be able to compare what
you wrote and what you heard to actually what

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.340
was said in the conversation.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.240
In the transcript as well, we're going to
focus on three new vocabulary words that will

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.390
help to build your vocabulary and increase
your understanding.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:25.230
You just heard Nathan say, "You will receive
a topic or a prompt."

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.230
"Okay."

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:32.200
"And you have to get up in front of the group
and do a one to two minute speech off the

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200
cuff."

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200
"Wow."

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.150
"With an introduction, you know, just like
any normal speech."

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.710
"That's bound to terrify anybody."

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.290
"Right.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.940
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:48.990
most."

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.250
In this quick conversation, Nathan is explaining
different parts of the Toastmasters meeting

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.980
that they have to improve public speaking
each week.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.230
One of the parts is giving a spontaneous speech
in front of the group and that's what he's

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.191
talking about in the beginning up here, let's
talk about these specific expressions, and

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:14.380
he says, yeah, this is really uncomfortable,
but you grow the most, you learn the most

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.680
because you are feeling uncomfortable.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.360
I think this is a great idea for learning
English because when you get outside your

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.430
comfort zone, it's tough, it's uncomfortable,
but you can grow a lot when you get outside

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.690
your comfort zone.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.370
So let's talk about these three specific vocabulary
words that we're going to focus on in this

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.830
conversation.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.020
The first one is one to two.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.310
You probably know what one and two means,
but when we put the preposition to between

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.890
there, one to two, we're talking about a range.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.120
He says you need to do a one to two minute
speech.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.460
The speech could be one minute, it could be
one and a half minutes, it could be two minutes,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.980
but it cannot be two and a half minutes.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.910
The range is one to two.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:05.870
And our sample sentence here is plane tickets
to Asia are usually one to $2,000.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.080
The range is $1,000 to $2,000.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.690
At the end of that sentence, he explains that
this isn't an ordinary speech that you prepare

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.690
for.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.380
It's a speech that you do off the cuff.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.380
Off the cuff.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.380
What is this expression?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.330
Well, a cuff is a part of a dress shirt, it
goes around your wrist.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.280
We say that's your cuff around your wrist,
but this is an idiom, so it's not really related

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.680
to dress shirts.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.050
It just means that you're doing something
without planning, so you have to give a spontaneous

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:41.710
speech or you have to give a speech off the
cuff.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:47.190
Our sample sentence here is, he told me off
the cuff that he is moving to Mexico.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.920
He didn't plan to tell me, we weren't talking
about his future plans, he just said, "Hey,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.450
I'm moving to Mexico week."

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.700
Whoa, this is really spontaneous and off the
cuff.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.810
The final expression that we're going to talk
about is one that I used, and it's to be bound

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.700
to do something.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.350
The word bound has several different meanings,
but specifically in this conversation I'm

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.800
talking about something that's definite.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.180
It's certain.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.120
So I said that's bound to terrify anybody.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.030
We can substitute some words here and say,
that is definitely going to terrify anybody.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.360
Giving a spontaneous speech for one to two
minutes, I think anybody would be terrified,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:37.050
fearful about doing that, so I use the wonderful
verb that's bound to terrify anybody.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:42.220
Our sample sentence here is if you win the
lottery, old friends from high school are

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.520
bound to contact you and ask for money.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.260
This is kind of the stereotypical situation
that when you suddenly get a lot of money

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.200
and it's a publicly known fact, people from
your past start to call you and say, "Oh,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.360
I've missed you.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.510
How have you been?"

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.190
Because they just want some money.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.030
So this is a definite, a certain situation.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.300
Old friends from high school are definitely
going to contact you and ask for money.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:14.250
Or we could say, they are bound to contact
you and ask for money.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.850
If you didn't understand those three vocabulary
words when Nathan and I said them, it's probably

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.650
because you don't know them and hopefully
now they feel a little bit more comfortable

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.650
to you.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:28.310
So what we're going to do is we're going to
listen to the original fast conversation again

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.930
and I hope that this time you'll be able to
hear some of those new expressions because

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:38.110
you know the general meaning of the conversation,
you'll feel a little bit more comfortable,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.100
and you'll see that just in the last couple
minutes, your listening skills group.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.840
Are you ready to listen?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.890
Let's listen to the original conversation
a couple times while looking at the transcript

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.150
so that you can listen and see at the same
time.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.150
Let's listen.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.650
Nathan: You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.060
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one to two minute speech

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.060
off the cuff.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.060
Vanessa: Wow.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.610
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.150
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.550
Nathan: Right.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.400
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400
most.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.650
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.010
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one to two minute speech

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.010
off the cuff.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.010
Vanessa: Wow.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.560
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.100
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.500
Nathan: Right.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.230
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.010
most.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.270
You will receive a topic or a prompt-
Vanessa: Okay.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.630
Nathan: And you have to get up in front of
the group and do a one to two minute speech

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.630
off the cuff.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.630
Vanessa: Wow.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.180
Nathan: With an introduction, you know, just
like any normal speech.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.720
Vanessa: That's bound to terrify anybody.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.130
Nathan: Right.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.850
And that's really the most uncomfortable part
of the meeting, but it's where you grow the

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.850
most.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.850
Vanessa: How did you do?

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.290
Could you understand a little bit better than
before?

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.990
Imagine if you studied like this for five
to 10 minutes every day for 30 days.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:07.920
If you did this and studied consistently,
your listening skills are bound to increase.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.691
Thousands of English learners around the world
have already joined the 30 Day Listening Challenge

00:15:13.691 --> 00:15:19.580
pack one, pack two, and pack three, and now
the pack four is open.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.740
So I encourage you to check it out and to
study like this every day for 30 days.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:30.740
Students in the course said that some days
were more challenging for them and some days

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:37.620
were easier for them, but by the end of the
month they had dedicated themselves to studying

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.710
and analyzing real conversation clips with
over 11 different native English speakers

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.530
for five to 10 minutes every day.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.620
And in the end, their listening fluency improved,
but most importantly they could take those

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.250
skills that they learned in the course and
use them in the real world.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.700
It's great to improve with the course material,
but it's essential to be able to use that

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.820
when you travel to another country, when you
have a business meeting, when you have a conversation

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.640
with someone, when you're watching a TV show.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.330
You want to be able to transfer those skills
to the real world and that's something that's

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:18.060
excellent about the Listening Challenge because
this is real material, this is real conversations

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060
from native speakers.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.270
So you'll be able to use it in the real world.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:28.621
Starting from today, December 20th to December
31st the 30-day English Listening Challenge

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:32.950
pack four is open for $30.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.500
If you haven't joined pack one, two or three,
don't worry.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.500
It's okay.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.790
Each pack is an individual course.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:45.630
They all are the same level because they all
feature real English conversations with real

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.610
native speakers, but you can study each course,
each pack individually.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.370
The challenge will start on January 1st.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:58.570
This means that I will send you the day one
material on January 1st.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:04.449
It includes all four things that we looked
at today, the fast original clip, a slow version

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:10.449
of the clip, a worksheet so that you can write
down exactly what you hear, and also a transcript

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:16.069
with three new vocabulary expressions so that
you can expand your vocabulary out as well

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.040
as your listening skills.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.629
Let's go on and take a quick sneak peak inside
the course website so that you can see exactly

00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:24.259
what you'd be studying.

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:29.519
When you join the 30-day Listening Challenge
pack four, you'll get access to this page

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:30.929
immediately.

00:17:30.929 --> 00:17:32.500
Today is day zero.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.419
Any day before January 1st is day zero.

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:38.570
Let's see what you can access today.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:45.799
You'll find a course guide with my recommended
study plan for each day, as well as a calendar

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:49.289
that you can use to check off each day when
you finish.

00:17:49.289 --> 00:17:55.090
I recommend printing these two documents and
looking them over before January 1st so that

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.130
you're comfortable with how you're going to
study the different material that you're going

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.379
to study before the course actually begins
on January 1st.

00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:09.110
On day one, January 1st, you'll have access
to the day one lesson, which you can download

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.570
or stream on the website.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:16.820
Then on January 2nd, you'll have access to
the day to lesson, and on January 3rd you'll

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.169
have access to the day three lesson, etc.
throughout the rest of the month.

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:25.520
If you enjoyed today's lesson but you'd like
some more information, no problem, you can

lesson helpful for you?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400
I hope so.

Thank you so much for learning English with
me, and I hope to see you for five to 10 minutes
